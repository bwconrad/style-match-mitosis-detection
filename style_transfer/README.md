# Style Transfer on Scanner Images

## Setup 
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Midog dataset needs to divided into separate directories for each scanner (`data/1/`,`data/2/`,`data/3/`,`data/4/`). Every 50 consecutive images should be placed into separate directories scanner (ie. `1.tiff` to `50.tiff` should be in `data/1/`).

### Notebook setup 
- Weights for the model's used in `inference.ipynb` can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A7LtjnzogBOYf0eS_zuCTPr8RGgD2xj6/view?usp=sharing). Unzip its contents in the root directory so you have a `checkpoints/` directory.
